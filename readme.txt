*Deprecated* -  The Dofollow plugin lets you remove the evil nofollow attribute from your comments. Because nofollow will not work.

== Description ==

This plugin's functionality has been merged into the [External Links plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sem-external-links/).
As a result this plugin is now deprecated.  No further development will occur on it though it shouldn't have any issues in future WP releases.
That is unless they change the default nofollow behavior.

The Dofollow plugin lets you remove the evil nofollow attribute from your comments. Because [nofollow will not work](http://www.semiologic.com/2005/02/05/prepare-for-more-comment-spam-not-less/).
