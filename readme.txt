*Deprecated* -  The Dofollow plugin lets you remove the evil nofollow attribute from your comments. Because nofollow will not work.

== Description ==

*This plugin's functionality has been merged into the [External Links plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sem-external-links/). As a result this plugin is now deprecated.  No further development will occur on it though it shouldn't have any issues in future WP releases. * (That is unless they change the default nofollow behavior.)

The Dofollow plugin lets you remove the evil nofollow attribute from your comments. Because [nofollow will not work](http://www.semiologic.com/2005/02/05/prepare-for-more-comment-spam-not-less/).
